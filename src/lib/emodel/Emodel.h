 * @section emodel_main_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Emodel(model) generic object system for Emodel View Controller.
 *
 * @section emodel_main_work How does Emodel work?
 *
 * The Model notifies Views and Controllers when there is a change in its state.
 * The other way around is also true and the Model can be passive and be poolled
 * for update rather than generating output representations.
 *
 * Concrete objects can implement functionalities by overriding Emodel's API, abstracting its complexities from
 * applications that can keep focus on higher level implementation.
 *
 * Examples of concrete implementations that can make use Emodel:
 *
 * Filesystem and I/O operations;
 * Database management;
 * GUI forms, lists and trees.
 *
 * Application code tends to be small in number of lines,
 * more simple and code readability is improved.
 *
 * Emodel use EO Events. Views and Controllers must register
 * in events to be able to recieve notifications about state changes in Emodel.
 * Some of currently available events are:
 *
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_PROPERTIES_CHANGE
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_PROPERTY_CHANGE
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_CHILD_ADD
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_CHILD_DEL
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_CHILD_SELECTED
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_CHILDREN_GET
 *   EMODEL_EVENT_CHILDREN_COUNT_GET
 *
 *   Example code using Emodel_Eio that returns the number of files in '/tmp' directory:
 *
 *   @code
 * static Eina_Bool
 * _children_count_cb(void *data EINA_UNUSED, Eo *obj EINA_UNUSED, const Eo_Event_Description *desc EINA_UNUSED, void *event_info)
 * {
 *    unsigned int *len = event_info;
 *    fprintf(stdout, "Children count len=%d\n", *len);
 *    return EINA_TRUE;
 * }
 *
 * int
 * main(int argc, const char **argv)
 * {
 *    if(!ecore_init())
 *    {
 *       fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Cannot init Ecore!\n");
 *       return 1;
 *    }
 *    if(!eio_init())
 *    {
 *       fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: Cannot init Eio!\n");
 *       return 1;
 *    }
 *
 *    Eo *model = eo_add_custom(EMODEL_EIO_CLASS, NULL, emodel_eio_constructor("/tmp"));
 *    eo_do(model, eo_event_callback_add(EMODEL_EVENT_CHILDREN_COUNT_GET, _children_count_cb, NULL));
 *    eo_do(model, emodel_children_count_get());
 *
 *    ecore_main_loop_begin();
 *    eo_unref(model);
 *    eio_shutdown();
 *    ecore_shutdown();
 *    return 0;
 * }
 *   @endcode
 *
 *   In previous example the concrete Emodel_Eio counts, asynchronously, the number of files in given directory,
 *   when it is ready _children_count_cb() is invoked receiving the number of files as event_info data.
 *
 * This is achieved by registering the Model in EMODEL_EVENT_CHILDREN_COUNT_GET and then asking Emodel's concrete
 * implementation (Emodel_Eio) to count the number of files. When it is finished it then dispatches the event providing
 * data along with it.
 *
 *   The principles may remain the same for different events and the logic remains.
